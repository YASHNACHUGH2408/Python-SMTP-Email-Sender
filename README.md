# Python-SMTP-Email-Sender
This project demonstrates sending emails automatically using Python via an SMTP server. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) operates at the application layer. The program connects to Gmail over TCP, starts a secure TLS session, authenticates the sender, and sends a formatted email, illustrating real-time SMTP communication.
